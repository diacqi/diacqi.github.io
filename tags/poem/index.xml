      <description>15 years spent together
Throughout which you never left my side
I am finally faced with the challenge of having to say goodbye
Nothing could ever prepare me for this
Here&amp;rsquo;s to the times you never gave up on me
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier that you are going far in life
But I just wish it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so soon
You picked me up when I fell
You always lent a shoulder to cry on</description>

      <description>for when the last tree is felled
last animal, slaughtered
last drop of water, wasted
last grain of food, consumed
last wall, crumbled
what will humanity turn to?

      <title>Pride, Our Undoing</title>

      <description>for the world to decay,
we would need to take much away.
humanity&amp;rsquo;s pride would do the deed
humanity&amp;rsquo;s extinction would be guaranteed.
in a planet of 8 million kinds
of living beings
it is a folly to believe that
we matter the most.
