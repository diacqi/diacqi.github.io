      <description>&amp;ldquo;The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. &amp;lsquo;Even though I complain sometimes,&amp;rsquo; it said, &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m the heart of a person and people&amp;rsquo;s hearts are that way.</description>
