      <description>I woke up to hear the songs of a distant whale pod. “Wait, where am I?” I thought to myself, “In the middle of the ocean?! How did I get here?” I looked at my body and it was in one piece. The last thing I remember is that I ran into a car and then everything went blank&amp;hellip;
I frantically tried swimming to the surface to catch my breath but I noticed that I was not out of breath at all.</description>

      <description>I wished to be able to swim faster, so I could explore the vast turquoise. I wanted to go underwater and traverse what was beyond that barrier. I swam underwater and I could go significantly faster this time almost as if my wish came true. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that barrier this time around, it was illuminated enough with the natural sunlight and the bioluminescent animals.
A frenzy of sharks nearby caught my eye, they were circling around a shoal of tuna and diving in to eat as much of it as they could.</description>
