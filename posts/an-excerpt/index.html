        <p>&ldquo;The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. &lsquo;Even though I complain sometimes,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m the heart of a person and people&rsquo;s hearts are that way. People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don&rsquo;t deserve them, or that they&rsquo;ll be unable to achieve them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of the moments that could have been good but weren&rsquo;t, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&quot; &lsquo;My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,&rsquo; the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.</p>
<p>&quot; &lsquo;Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second&rsquo;s encounter with God and with eternity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&quot; &lsquo;Every second of the search is an encounter with God,&rsquo; the boy told his heart. &lsquo;When I have been truly searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because I&rsquo;ve known that every hour was part of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I&rsquo;ve discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
