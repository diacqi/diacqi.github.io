        <p>I woke up to hear the songs of a distant whale pod. “Wait, where am I?” I thought to myself, “In the
middle of the ocean?! How did I get here?” I looked at my body and it was in one piece. The last thing I
remember is that I ran into a car and then everything went blank&hellip;</p>
<p>I frantically tried swimming to the surface to catch my breath but I noticed that I was not out of breath
at all. I swam up anyway and looked around to see the endless ocean in all directions. Different species
of small fish were seen everywhere, some colourful, some in large synchronized schools.</p>
<p>“Ah, you are awake.” said a voice, “ took you long enough”. “Who is that?!” I asked awestruck, “where
are you? Where am I??” I saw whales surfacing in the distance and realized that that was the pod that I
heard underwater. Their songs were enchanting. If only I could understand what they were saying&hellip;</p>
<p>“They were talking about you” said a voice with a familiar resounding echo. I looked down to see a
whale swimming in small circles. For as long as I can remember I have been fond of whales and on
instinct I swam down towards it. “ Come and I will show you the depths” the whale said, “ yes, it is my
voice that you are hearing.”</p>
<p>It then struck me that it was the voice I heard before. I got near the side of the whale and it halted for a moment, I looked into its eye in astonishment. Up until now I had never gotten close to a whale and
only then did I notice how huge and magnificent its presence felt like. I slowly reached my hand out
and felt the scars on its body. I swam along its side in awe, it slowly floated and turned revealing the
distinctive patterns underneath it. It was colossal and yet had its own entrancing aura to it&hellip;</p>
<p>“Grab on” the whale said, “ I will show you something”.</p>
<p>I put my hand on its flipper and it slowly swam deeper. It all seemed so dark for me but I felt sure the
whale could see everything clearly. A gust of strong currents hit me suddenly, almost like I was going
through some sort of imaginary barrier underwater. Suddenly everything became illuminated, “ this is
the true blue” the whale said to me, “ this is where the fun begins.” The distant whale songs I heard
before seemed even louder now, they were close to me, I could feel it.</p>
<p>A small school of fish swam past us in a specific design like they were all in sync. Bioluminescent
jellyfish were seen everywhere. They were waddling upwards captivatingly. A pod of whales was
swimming towards us. There was a small group of dolphins surrounding the whales, perhaps they were
friends. The whales seemed to be swimming around me almost like they were suspicious of me and
were investigating.</p>
<p>From within the pod, a calf came up to me. It was the cutest thing I had ever seen. I touched it and the
mother whale who was close did not seem to have a problem. Could they sense that I wasn&rsquo;t a threat
to them and that I actually admired them more than anything? The whales started swimming upwards.
Each whale moving with its very own gracefulness and beauty, their sounds as melodious as ever.</p>
<p>After the whale pod went up, there was one which stayed behind. “They approve of your presence
here,” the whale said. It started swimming upwards too and I tried to catch up to it, but of course I was
not nearly as fast enough. While I tried hard to catch up, two dolphins came up to me and signalled as
though to say “need a ride?”, I held on to their fins while they swiftly ascended over and out of that
water barrier. The whales were breaching together and catching fish in nets of bubbles made from each
whale among the pod. It was a sight like this I yearned to witness my whole life.</p>
