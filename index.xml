      <description>15 years spent together
Throughout which you never left my side
I am finally faced with the challenge of having to say goodbye
Nothing could ever prepare me for this
Here&amp;rsquo;s to the times you never gave up on me
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier that you are going far in life
But I just wish it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so soon
You picked me up when I fell
You always lent a shoulder to cry on</description>

      <description>for when the last tree is felled
last animal, slaughtered
last drop of water, wasted
last grain of food, consumed
last wall, crumbled
what will humanity turn to?

      <description>I woke up to hear the songs of a distant whale pod. “Wait, where am I?” I thought to myself, “In the middle of the ocean?! How did I get here?” I looked at my body and it was in one piece. The last thing I remember is that I ran into a car and then everything went blank&amp;hellip;
I frantically tried swimming to the surface to catch my breath but I noticed that I was not out of breath at all.</description>

      <description>I wished to be able to swim faster, so I could explore the vast turquoise. I wanted to go underwater and traverse what was beyond that barrier. I swam underwater and I could go significantly faster this time almost as if my wish came true. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that barrier this time around, it was illuminated enough with the natural sunlight and the bioluminescent animals.
A frenzy of sharks nearby caught my eye, they were circling around a shoal of tuna and diving in to eat as much of it as they could.</description>

      <title>Pride, Our Undoing</title>

      <description>for the world to decay,
we would need to take much away.
humanity&amp;rsquo;s pride would do the deed
humanity&amp;rsquo;s extinction would be guaranteed.
in a planet of 8 million kinds
of living beings
it is a folly to believe that
we matter the most.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. &amp;lsquo;Even though I complain sometimes,&amp;rsquo; it said, &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m the heart of a person and people&amp;rsquo;s hearts are that way.</description>
